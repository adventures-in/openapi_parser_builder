#### <a name="pathItemObject"></a>Path Item Object

Describes the operations available on a single path.
A Path Item MAY be empty, due to [ACL constraints](#securityFiltering).
The path itself is still exposed to the documentation viewer but they will not know which operations and parameters are available.
